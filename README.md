# Grade 9 Discord Server Bot

This is a bot made for the Grade 9 Discord Server. It's meant to replace as much bots currently on the server as possible.

## How to Run

Simply install the dependencies and run `main.py`. That's all we're going to say, since this isn't meant to be distributed to other users anyways.
