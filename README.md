# Grade 9 Discord Server Bot

This is a bot made for the Grade 9 Discord Server. It's meant to replace as much bots currently on the server as possible.

## How to Run

To run the Python version, simply run `run-py.sh` to run. And you need discord.py installed for that to work. I will add more information later.

To run the Typescript version, simply run `setup-js.sh` (Yes, it should be called `setup-ts.sh` instead, but I will change that later), and then run `run-js.sh`. You only need to run `setup-js.sh` once.
